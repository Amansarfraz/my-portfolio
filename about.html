    <h2>Nikkah Plus - Marriage Matching App</h2>
    <p>
      Nikah App is a modern matchmaking platform designed to help individuals and families connect for marriage in a secure, private, and culturally respectful way.
    </p>
    <p>
      It simplifies the search for a compatible partner through verified profiles, personalized matchmaking, and features that uphold trust and Islamic values.
    </p>
    <p>
      I worked on building the UI using Flutter, implemented secure user registration and login with Firebase Authentication, and handled real-time data using Cloud Firestore.
      Special focus was given to smooth user experience, privacy, and mobile responsiveness.
